Agriculture, recognized as a pivotal sector for economic development in numerous countries, 
plays a crucial role in providing sustenance to a large global population despite facing 
various limitations and challenges. The issue of food security is exacerbated by multiple 
factors, including climate change, a decline in pollinators, plant diseases, and others. Various 
efforts have been deployed to mitigate crop loss due to plant infections, with technological 
advancements offering valuable solutions to farmers.
In this context, smartphones emerge as innovative tools for disease identification, leveraging 
their computing power, high-resolution displays, and extensive built-in accessories, such as 
advanced HD cameras. This situation necessitates disease diagnosis based on automated 
image recognition; a task made feasible through the application of deep learning approaches. 
The research focuses on analyzing deep learning-based image detection techniques to 
identify diverse diseases affecting plants. The "PlantVillage" dataset serves as the foundation 
for training models, employing deep learning architectures including AlexNet, GoogleNet, 
ResNet50, and InceptionV3.
Two distinct approaches, namely 'training from scratch' and 'transfer learning,' are employed 
to train the model. Primary analysis results indicate that GoogleNet outperforms AlexNet, 
ResNet50, and InceptionV3 in the 'training from scratch' approach. Conversely, ResNet50 
excels in the transfer learning approach. The study underscores the potential of machine 
learning and deep learning in crop disease detection, contributing to the broader fields of 
agriculture and image detection.
